## Universal Design Principles

### Principle 1: Equitable Use
If released on the market, Plannr will be free to include users from different socioeconomic backgrounds. 
Our app does not have additional features that require users to have a more advanced skill level, it does not create 
segregation among users. It also offers the same password checking and account features for all users, ensuring that 
users have a password-protected account. Finally, Plannr's UI is simple and easy to use,with a nice design appealing to 
all users.


### Principle 2: Flexibility in Use
The Sort feature on the main page gives users the flexibility and choice of how they would like to sort their events, 
as users can sort either by time or priority. Plannr also offers a dark mode view to accommodate different visual 
preferences. In the future, an instructions page showing details on how to use the app can be added to Settings. 
Additionally, a more detailed setting page can be added to accommodate more customizations in the future. Preferences 
such as currency types (such as CAD or USD) display the time (24 hours vs. AM or PM) should be included within the 
settings page, allowing users to adjust accordingly.


### Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use
When first launched, Plannr prompts the user to sign up or log in straightforwardly, displaying large buttons with clear 
text. Plannr provides feedback for text fields, such as name, email, and password, when signing up. If they are left 
blank or have the incorrect input type, it suggests changes to the user. It also prompts the user to enter a strong 
password that follows certain password requirements clearly printed underneath the textbox after a failed attempt. 
Finally, the language and vocabulary within Plannr are simple and comprehensive.


### Principle 4: Perceptible Information
Plannr uses large bold text for important headings that represent different functions within the app, such as expenses, 
to-dos and adding school events. It also has large buttons with legible text that stands out on a white background. 
Plannr has icons for the different types of school events to avoid cluttering the add event view with text.
In addition to dark mode, the colour scheme of the entire UI (black, white and purple) ensures there is high contrast, 
and all features are visible.


### Principle 5: Tolerance for Error
Plannr has fail-safe features that stop the user from inputting an empty school event, empty expense, income or settings 
text box with error messages.The most used element, the to-do list, is displayed as the main view, while settings and 
other less commonly used features have to be located using the navigation menu. In the future, Plannr should contain 
more detailed error checking for text inputs such as whether the user's name is allowed to have numbers or not.


### Principle 6: Low Physical Effort
In the future, Plannr will allow users to add multiple expenses and events at once without being redirected to the 
main view, or the main expenses view to minimize repetitive action. As a mobile app, Plannr does not require excessive 
physical effort to use. It also does not have any advanced graphic features that would drain battery life.


### Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use
This principle is not applicable for Plannr as it is a mobile app (software) and does not come with additional hardware
elements that would need to accommodate a variety of users.

## Target Market
The target market for Plannr would be students ranging from high school to university. Plannr offers an option for users 
to input school events such as deadlines which are most commonly associated with student life. Students often have 
difficulties balancing all their academic dates, such as deadlines, tests, study sessions or assignments, so seeing all 
their events on a to-do list will encourage them to stay on track. In addition, many students are learning how to budget 
money effectively for the first time and tracking their spending offers great visual support. When a user sees their 
list of expenses and the total at the bottom, it will encourage them to be more mindful about their spending. Moreover, 
the Plannr UI targets a younger population with its playful design and colour scheme. Overall, it would be beneficial 
for students looking for an organizational platform that combines both their academic and financial life for easy access.

## Least Likely Demographic
People who are not students would not find Plannr particularly useful. Specifically, younger students in elementary 
school or children would be less likely to use Planner. They would have no use for the expense features; they do not 
have a stable source of income or are not managing their own finances. In addition, older adults who are retired or not 
students are less likely to use the school work-related features. Finally, middle-aged adults will have no use for both 
the school work and the expenses features. Many employed adults have already graduated from high school or university 
and are already using more advanced banking apps that automatically display their expenditures.
